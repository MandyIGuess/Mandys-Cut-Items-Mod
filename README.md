# *Mandy's-Cut-Items-Mod*
This mod is a remake of my 'Removed & Unused Mod' that added, well, removed and unused things back into the game. The issue with R&U was that I made the textures for things from scratch (Also I didn't know how to do texture shading back then so it looked very flat and ugly) instead of using the original textures. Things were a mess, so I officially canceled it when it's MCreator workspace got corrupted, rendering updates impossible to do. I have a release here of the mod's final version if you want to compare it to this new mod. You can find it in the Releases tab, the second to last one down the list. More info about the mod can be found here: https://mcreator.net/node/64554


## How To Set Up

### Step One
  Download whatever version of *Mandy's Cut Items Mod* you wish to use, then ensure you have the correct Minecraft Forge version (I recommend downloading the 'Recommended Version' on the Forge Website, which can be found here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/).
      
### Step Two
  Once the Jar has finished downloading, locate the .minecraft folder by pressing WIN + R to open the Windows finder program, 'Run'. Then, type in `%appdata%`, and it will take you to `\Appdata\Roaming`. The `.minecraft` folder will be near the top. (Everything beyond this in step two is an alternative method to getting to the folder -->) Alternatively, you can go to `C:\Users\Your User Name`, and then open the 'View' tab in the top ribbon (If it's not there, click on the little arrow on the far right, it should bring it down), and enable the check box 'Hidden items', to show hidden files and folders. The Appdata folder will be visible, go into it and then to 'Roaming', you will arrive at the same place as you would if you used the Run program.
  
### Step Three
  In the `.minecraft` folder, you will need to make a new folder and name it `mods`. If you've installed mods before, then you may have one already. Place the mod jar in the folder, and ensure no mods for older versions of Minecraft are in there (Only if you've installed mods before), if there are, delete them or move them out of the folder.
  
### Step Four
  Now that you've placed the mod in the folder, open the Minecraft Launcher, and run your Forge version, if it's not in the menu of installations, make a new one and locate the Forge version you need for the mod. Once the game boots up, ensure the mod is in the 'Mods' menu on the Main Menu of the game. If it is there, then you've installed the mod, if not, run through these steps again and figure out what went wrong.
