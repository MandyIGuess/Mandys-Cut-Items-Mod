# *Mandy's-Cut-Items-Mod*
This mod is a remake of my 'Removed & Unused Mod' that added, well, removed and unused things back into the game. The issue with R&U was that I made the textures for things from scratch (Also I didn't know how to do texture shading back then so it looked very flat and ugly) instead of using the original textures. Things were a mess, so I officially canceled it when it's MCreator workspace got corrupted, rendering updates impossible to do. I have a release here of the mod's final version if you want to compare it to this new mod. You can find it in the Releases tab, the second to last one down the list. More info about the mod can be found here: https://mcreator.net/node/64554

## Setting Up

### Step One
  Download the version of *Mandy's Cut Items Mod* you wish to use, then ensure you have the corresponding *Minecraft Forge* version from here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/. Download the correct version of Forge, and install it.
  
### Step Two
  Once the JAR has finished downloading, locate the .minecraft folder by pressing WIN + R to open the Windows finder program, 'Run'. Then, type in `%appdata%`, and it will take you to `\Appdata\Roaming`. The `.minecraft` folder will be near the top. 
  
Alternatively, you can go to `C:\Users\YourUserName`, and then open the 'View' tab in the top ribbon (if it's not there, click on the little arrow on the far right, it should bring it down), and enable the check box 'Hidden items', to show hidden files and folders. The Appdata folder will be visible, go into it and then to 'Roaming', you will arrive at the same place as you would if you used the Run program.
  
### Step Three
  In the `.minecraft` folder, you will need to make a new folder and name it `mods`. If you've installed mods before, then you may have one already. Place the mod jar in the folder, and ensure no mods for older versions of Minecraft are in the folder, if there are, remove them from the folder.
  
### Step Four
  Now that you've placed the mod in the folder, open the Minecraft Launcher, and run your Forge version, if it's not in the menu of installations, make a new one and locate the Forge version you need for the mod. Once the game boots up, ensure the mod is in the 'Mods' menu on the Titlescreen. If you see it in there, you're set to start playing. If not, see the section below to troubleshoot what's gone wrong.

## Troubleshooting
This section will troubleshoot why *Mandy's Cut Items Mod* won't function in-game. Keep in mind this isn't for troubleshooting bugs, but instead troubleshooting the mod JAR not being loaded by Forge. If none of these work, or you'd like to report a bug you find, DM me on Discord, my usertag is `MandyIGuess#9999`.

### #1 -- Ensure your installed Forge version is compatible with the version of the mod JAR.
This is a mistake that can be made, always make sure the mod's JAR file is compatible with the version of Minecraft Forge you are running. If you have Forge for `1.16.5`, the `1.17.1` version of this mod will not support it.

### #2 -- Ensure the mod JAR is in the correct folder of the `.minecraft` directory.
The mod JAR should *always* be in a folder called `mods`. Not in `Mods`, nor any extension of the word.

### #3 -- Check to ensure the downloaded mod JAR isn't corrupt.
This can be done multiple ways:
- Open the mod JAR with a tool like WinRAR, and if you get errors while doing so (corruption errors or the like), redownload the mod JAR.
- If the file itself is 0 bytes large, that's a large indicator that something's gone wrong.
